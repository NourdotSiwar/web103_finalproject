## About

### Description and Purpose

MacroMate is a nutrition tracking web app designed to help users hit their daily calorie and macro targets based on their fitness goal — whether they're on a cut, bulk, or maintenance phase. Users build meals from a reusable food item library, each with detailed macro data (calories, protein, carbs, fat), and MacroMate automatically calculates their daily totals against their personal targets.

### Inspiration

Counting macros is one of the most effective ways to reach a body composition goal, but most dedicated macro tracking apps are either too complex, paywalled, or cluttered with features most people don't need. We wanted to build a clean, straightforward tool focused on the core loop: set your goal, log your food, see your numbers.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, React Router

Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (using Render)

## Features

### Set Your Macro Goal

Users select a goal (cut, bulk, or maintain) and input their daily calorie, protein, carb, and fat targets. These targets are used across the app to track progress.

### Food Item Library [✅]

Users can create, edit, and delete reusable food items. Each food item stores its name, calories, protein, carbs, fat, and serving unit (g, oz, cup, etc.).

### Build a Meal

Users create a meal (e.g. "Breakfast", "Post-workout") and add food items to it with a specific quantity/serving. MacroMate auto-calculates the meal's total macros from its food items.

### Daily Macro Dashboard

A dashboard shows all meals logged for the day, the running macro totals, and progress bars comparing consumed vs. target for calories, protein, carbs, and fat.

### Meal History Log

Users can browse past meals by date to review what they ate and how their macros looked on any given day.

### Remaining Macros Calculator [✅]

After logging meals, MacroMate shows how many calories and grams of each macro the user still has left for the day, helping them plan their next meal.

### Meal Macro Breakdown

Each meal displays a visual macro breakdown (percentage of calories from protein, carbs, and fat) so users can quickly spot imbalanced meals.
